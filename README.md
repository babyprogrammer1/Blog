# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will launch Vite with hot module replacement enabled.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist` directory.

## Previewing the Production Build

You can preview the production build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves the built app at `http://localhost:4173` by default.
